# UwULogs for Warmane (Icecrown) [NOT LONGER SUPPORTED]

**UwULogs_Icecrown** is an addon that displays competitive performance rankings directly within the game. It provides a quick and easy way to check if a player appears in the **UwU Logs Top 1000 rankings** based on data from (https://uwu-logs.xyz).


## How It Works
